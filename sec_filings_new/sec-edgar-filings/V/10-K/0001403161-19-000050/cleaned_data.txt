•	We facilitate secure, reliable and convenient transactions between financial institutions, merchants and account holders. We traditionally have referred to this as the ‘four party’ model. As the payments ecosystem continues to evolve, we are continuing to broaden this model to include digital banks, wallets and a range of financial technology companies (fintechs), governments and non-governmental organizations. We provide transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through VisaNet, our global processing platform. During fiscal year 2019, we saw 201.9 billion payments and cash transactions with Visa’s brand, equating to an average of 553 million transactions a day. Of the 201.9 billion total transactions, 138.3 billion were processed by Visa.


•	We offer a wide range of Visa-branded payment products that our 15,500 financial institution clients use to develop and offer core business solutions, including credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for individual, business and government account holders. During fiscal year 2019, Visa’s total payments and cash volume grew to $11.6 trillion and more than 3.4 billion cards were available worldwide to be used at more than 61 million merchant locations.


•	We take an open, partnership approach and seek to provide value by enabling access to our global network, including offering our technology capabilities through application programming interfaces (APIs). Additionally, we enter into partnerships with both traditional and emerging players to innovate and expand the payments ecosystem. This approach helps our partners leverage the resources of our platform to scale and grow their businesses more quickly and effectively.


•	We are accelerating the migration to digital payments by enabling new types of transactions beyond the core consumer-to-business (C2B) payments. These include person-to-person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments.


•	We provide value-added services to our clients, including consulting and analytics, fraud management and security services, merchant solutions, processing capabilities and digital services like tokenization.


•	We invest in and promote our brand to the benefit of our clients and partners through advertising, promotional and sponsorship initiatives with FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, and the National Football League, among others. We also use these sponsorship assets to showcase our payment innovations.

(3)  Actual fund availability depends on receiving financial institution and region. Visa requires fast-funds enabled issuers to make funds available to their recipient account holders within a maximum of 30 minutes of approving the transaction.


•	We continued to see the benefits of chip technology in preventing counterfeit fraud and reducing the amount and rate of fraud taking place in-person at physical stores. In the U.S., for example, our most recent data shows an 87 percent decline in counterfeit fraud at chip-enabled merchants since 2015, when the industry began to deploy chip technology.


•	EMV® 3-D Secure (3DS) is a new generation of the protocol — developed by Visa, other payment brands and industry participants as part of EMVCo — and is designed to protect accounts from unauthorized use across desktop, laptop, mobile or other connected devices, making online purchases easier and more secure. In 2019, Visa branded its 3DS program as Visa Secure (formerly Verified by Visa). The Visa Secure visual badge, combined with descriptive language emphasizing, “Your online transactions are secure with Visa,” will be the way consumers encounter Visa’s 3DS offering.

•	competitors, clients, network participants, and others are developing or participating in alternate payment networks or products, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, real-time and faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from consumer checking accounts, that could reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives from The Clearing House, an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments system; Early Warning Services, which operates Zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; and the Libra Association, which seeks to launch a new stablecoin crypto-currency (Libra Coin) and global blockchain-based payments network;


•	similarly, many countries are developing or promoting domestic networks, switches and real-time payment systems. To the extent these governments mandate local banks and merchants to use and accept these systems for domestic transactions and/or prohibit international payment networks, like Visa, from participating on those systems, we could face the risk of our business being disintermediated in those countries. Furthermore, in some regions, such as Southeast Asia, under the auspices of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), some countries are looking into cross-border connectivity of such domestic systems;


•	parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain;


•	parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms;


•	participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; and


•	new or revised industry standards related to EMV Secure Remote Commerce, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other payments-related technologies set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, World Wide Web Consortium, European Card Standards Group, PCI Co and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services.


•	disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and management’s attention from our existing business


•	greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses


•	failure to develop the acquired business adequately


•	the data security, cybersecurity and operational resilience posture of our acquired companies, or companies we invest in or partner with, may not be adequate


•	difficulty, expense or failure of implementing controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company


•	challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technologies


•	failure to retain employees, clients or partners of the acquired business


•	in the case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages

(1)	Our results of operations and the financial position beginning with the last quarter of fiscal 2016 include Visa Europe’s financial results.


(2)	During fiscal 2016, upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe.


(3)	During fiscal 2018, as a result of the U.S. tax reform legislation, our net income reflected a lower statutory tax rate, a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion from the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities, and a one-time transition tax of approximately $1.1 billion.


(4)	During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion.


(5)	During fiscal 2018, pursuant to an amended settlement agreement that superseded the 2012 Settlement Agreement related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, we recorded an accrual of $600 million. During fiscal 2019, related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, we made payments of $600 million, partially offset by an additional accrual of $370 million. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


(6)	During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

(2)	Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below.


•	Litigation provision. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $370 million and $600 million, respectively, and related tax benefits of $83 million and $137 million, respectively, associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.


•	Charitable contributions


▪	During fiscal 2018, we donated investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million, before tax, and recorded $193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income decreased by $49 million.


▪	During fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million.


•	Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.


•	Transition tax on foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimate of approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.


•	Elimination of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.


(6)	Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.

•	Service revenues increased primarily due to 6% growth in nominal payments volume and select pricing modifications.


•	Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 11% as well as select pricing modifications.


•	International transaction revenues increased primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 2% and select pricing modifications.


•	Other revenues increased primarily due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard and an increase in revenues from value-added services.


•	Client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2019 and overall growth in global payments volume. As a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, client incentives were also impacted by changes in classification and timing of recognition. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

(2)	Operating expenses for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance as they are related to the interchange multidistrict litigation provision or charitable donations. See Overview within this Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


•	Personnel expenses increased due to continued headcount growth in support of our investment strategy for future growth.


•	Marketing expenses increased mainly due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain marketing expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard. The increase was partially offset by spend for the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang and 2018 FIFA World CupTM in fiscal 2018, which did not recur in fiscal 2019.


•	General and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain general and administrative expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, higher indirect taxes, higher product enhancement costs and global facilities expansion in support of our business growth.The increase was partially offset by a $195 million charitable contribution to the Visa Foundation in fiscal 2018, which did not recur in fiscal 2019.


•	Litigation provision decreased primarily due to a $370 million accrual in fiscal 2019 compared to a $600 million accrual in fiscal 2018 related to the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

•	Interest expense decreased primarily as a result of entering into derivative instruments in fiscal 2019 that lowered the average cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt. See Note 9—Debt and Note 12—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


•	Investment income and other decreased primarily due to gains of $193 million from the donation of investment securities to the Visa Foundation in fiscal 2018 which did not recur fiscal 2019, offset by higher gains on our equity investments and interest income on our cash and investments. See Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

•	new provisions enacted as part of the Tax Act, including the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”); and


•	the absence of the following items recorded in fiscal 2018:


▪	a $1.1 billion one-time transition tax expense on certain untaxed foreign earnings in accordance with the Tax Act;


▪	a $1.1 billion non-recurring, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances due to the reduction in U.S. federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act; and

•	make planned capital investments in our business;


•	pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and


•	invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.

(1)	Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


(2)	Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.


(3)	Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty-six years.


(4)	Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


(5)	Includes expected dividend amount of $673 million as dividends were declared on October 22, 2019 and will be paid on December 3, 2019 to all holders of record of Visa’s common stock as of November 15, 2019.


(6)	We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.7 billion as of September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, we had also accrued $165 million of interest and $26 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.


(7)	We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


(8)	Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to fifteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets or marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. As of September 30, 2019, we have $4.1 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements.

(1)	Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.


(2)	Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 400 million, 403 million and 405 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 46 million, 49 million and 58 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million, 32 million and 33 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.


(3)	Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 3 million, 3 million and 5 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 1 million, 1 million and 2 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.


(4)	Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. See Note 14—Stockholders’ Equity.

(1)	Until March 2018, this assumption was based on the Company’s historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believed to be generally comparable to Visa. The Company’s data was weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visa’s IPO date as a percentage of the options’ contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visa’s data and peer data for stock options granted until March 2018 was approximately 97% and 3% in fiscal 2018, respectively, and 87% and 13% in fiscal 2017, respectively. The assumptions for stock options granted after March 2018 was based on Visa’s historical exercise experience as the passage of time since the Company’s IPO has exceeded 10 years.


(2)	Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards.
