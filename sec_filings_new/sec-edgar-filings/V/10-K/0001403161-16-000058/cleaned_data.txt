•	Evolve our client interactions to build deeper partnerships with financial institutions, merchants and new industry partners;


•	Transform Visa’s technology assets to drive efficiency and enable innovation;


•	Achieve success as a leading partner for digital payments comparable to what we have achieved in the physical world;


•	Expand access to Visa products and services globally;


•	Champion payment system security for the industry; and


•	Be the employer of choice for top talent.


(1)	UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table as Visa currently does not compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart.


(2)	The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa. Visa Europe data are included.


(3)	MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1085 (April 2016). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products.


•	competitors, clients and others are developing alternative payment networks or products that could disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives like The Clearing House, an ACH-based payment system comprised of large financial institutions, and EWS, an alternative to an ACH payment system that provides faster funds or real-time payments across P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions;


•	similarly, multiple countries are developing or promoting ACH-based real-time payment systems or mandating local networks with clients that also present a risk of disintermediation to our business;


•	parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain;


•	parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or utilize our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms;


•	competitors, clients and others may develop methods to use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to compete with, impair or replace digital payment products that use and support our network and processing over our network;


•	we may need to adjust our local rules and practices to remain competitive amidst evolving regulatory landscapes and competitors’ practices;


•	we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by our customers, processors or other third parties, thereby increasing operational costs;


•	we may need to agree to business arrangements with terms less protective of Visa’s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete with others, including those with issuers and with competing networks;


•	participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services;


•	competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ACH payments or direct debit of consumer checking accounts;


•	new players and intermediaries in the payments value chain may redirect transactions or steer participants away from our network;


•	we may face increasing risk of others asserting their intellectual property rights and potential litigation, as market entrants include technology companies and companies from industries where patent rights are actively asserted;


•	as this landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new business, products, services and practices; or


•	new or revised industry standards related to EMV-chip payment technology, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other technologies set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services.


•	disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and management’s attention from our existing business;


•	greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses;


•	failure to develop the acquired business adequately;


•	difficulty implementing controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;


•	challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems and technology;


•	failure to retain employees, clients or partners of the acquired business;


•	in the case of foreign acquisitions such as the acquisition of Visa Europe, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political and regulatory risks associated with operating in new regions or countries. For more information on regulatory risks, please see Item 1—Business—Government Regulations and Item 1A—Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks above;


•	discovery of unidentified issues after the acquisition or investment was made;


•	failure to mitigate the liabilities of the acquired business; for example, while we have attempted to mitigate the risk of loss associated with certain Visa Europe litigation through the issuance of the preferred stock, there can be no guarantee that the liabilities associated with that litigation will not exceed the value of such preferred stock;


•	dilutive issuance of equity securities, if new securities are issued;


•	potential incurrence of debt, including the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with the Visa Europe acquisition;


•	negative impact on our financial position and/or statement of operations; and


•	anticipated benefits or value of the investment or acquisition not materializing.


•	no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance;


•	no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis;


•	the affirmative votes of the class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock are required for certain types of consolidations or mergers;


•	our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders’ meeting and may not act by written consent; and


•	only the board of directors, Chairman or CEO may call a special meeting of stockholders.

(1)	We did not include Visa Europe's financial results in our consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. Our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2016 does include Visa Europe's financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Further, our financial results for fiscal 2016 include the impact of several significant one-time items. See Overview within Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.


(2)	During fiscal 2013, we made payments from the U.S. litigation escrow account totaling $4.4 billion in connection with the U.S. covered litigation. During fiscal 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. Certain merchants in the settlement classes objected to the settlement and filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received and deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account, and a related increase in accrued litigation to address the opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. An additional accrual of $450 million associated with these opt-out claims was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Payments totaling $528 million were made from fiscal 2014 through 2016 from the U.S. litigation escrow account reflecting settlements with a number of individual opt-out merchants, resulting in an accrued balance of $978 million related to U.S. covered litigation as of September 30, 2016. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


(3)	During fiscal 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities, of which $239 million relates to prior fiscal years.


(4)	During fiscal 2014, we recorded a $264 million tax benefit related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years.


(5)	During fiscal 2012, we recorded: a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities; a U.S. covered litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits; and the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and interest, which increased net income by $326 million.


(6)	The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015.

(2)	The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015.


(3)	Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below.


•	Severance cost. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million.


•	Remeasurement of deferred tax liability. In September 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of  Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom.


•	Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of U.K. stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable


•	Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss. Upon consummation of the transaction, on June 21, 2016, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. See Note 12—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the Closing. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million.


•	Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a decrease of $255 million and an increase of $110 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income and expense in other non-operating income. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe and Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Litigation provision. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a litigation provision of $450 million and related tax benefits of $167 million associated with the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be paid from the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(4)	Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.


(5)	Our nominal payments volume, total payments volume growth and total volume growth for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 reflect the related nominal payments volume of Visa Europe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which impacts our service revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.


(6)	Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.

•	Service revenues, which includes revenues earned by Visa Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter, increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 primarily due to 16% and 7% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. The growth in fiscal 2016 service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. Fiscal 2016 growth also reflects select pricing modifications which became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.


•	Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 17% and 9%, respectively, which includes data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield.


•	International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 37%, including revenues earned by Visa Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter. In addition to the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our international transaction revenue yield, fiscal 2016 growth also reflects select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by higher volatility in a broad range of currencies, combined with select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.


•	Client incentives increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015, reflecting overall growth in global payments volume,  incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and Visa Europe's incentives for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

(2)	Our operating expenses for fiscal 2016 do not reflect the expenses incurred by Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. Operating expenses incurred by Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are reflected in fiscal 2016 total operating expenses.


(3)	Operating expenses for fiscal 2016 and 2014 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance as they are related to the Visa Europe acquisition, or are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Overview within this Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


•	Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a severance charge related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe, combined with an increase from the inclusion of Visa Europe fiscal fourth quarter expenses. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in contractor


•	Marketing expenses in fiscal 2016 reflect efficiencies in production and agency costs which were redeployed for other marketing uses, and Visa Europe expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter. The decrease in marketing during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was mainly due to the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar as marketing spend in local currencies was converted to U.S. dollars, combined with the absence of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and 2014 FIFA World Cup spend that was incurred in fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially offset by increases in promotional campaigns that support our growth strategies and product initiatives.


•	Network and processing expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions that transitioned to the Russian National Payment Card system during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2015 was a result of initiatives to optimize the use of our technology resources. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Professional fees increased in fiscal 2016 primarily reflecting transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Visa Europe. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Depreciation and amortization expenses in fiscal 2016 were flat compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.


•	General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2016 mainly due to costs incurred related to our acquisition of Visa Europe and the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. The increase was also attributable to net foreign exchange losses incurred as a result of changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against other currencies in which we transact. The increase in fiscal 2015 was mainly due to an increase in travel activities, product enhancements and facilities costs in support of our business growth, combined with losses incurred from the sale of assets held by an international subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains and the absence of the fiscal 2014 disposal of obsolete technology assets.


•	Litigation provision decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the absence of a loss incurred in fiscal 2015 upon the settlement of uncovered litigation. The decrease in fiscal 2015 reflects the absence of a $450 million accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation incurred in fiscal 2014. See Note 20—Legal Matters and Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss resulted from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe upon consummation of the transaction. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

(2)	Our non-operating income (expense) for fiscal 2016 does not reflect the financial results of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. Fiscal 2016 non-operating income (expense) includes financial results of Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Interest expense increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to the issuance of $16.0 billion fixed-rate senior notes in December 2015. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Other non-operating income (expense) in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of the following:


•	net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As these contracts are not designated in hedging relationships, related gains and losses are recorded directly in earnings as part of non-operating income (expense);


•	a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the Closing;


•	a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero; and


•	a non-cash adjustment of $110 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to increase the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax.


•	the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate;


•	an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016;


•	the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016; and


•	the absence of a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million was a one-time $239 million tax benefit that related to prior fiscal years.


•	the aforementioned $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015; and


•	a $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years.

(1)	In December 2015, we issued $16.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in conjunction with the acquisition of Visa Europe with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on the Notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14 of each year. Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.


(2)	Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.


(3)	Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to nineteen years.


(4)	Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record.


(5)	Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.


(6)	Includes expected dividend amount of $400 million as dividends were declared in October 2016 and will be paid on December 6, 2016 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 18, 2016.


(7)	On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.


(8)	We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $911 million. At September 30, 2016, we had also accrued $61 million of interest and $17 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.


(9)	We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

•	issued preferred stock of the Company convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock of the Company, as described below, equivalent to a value of €5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016; and


•	agreed to pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing.


•	series A convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which is generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company’s class A common stock (the “class A equivalent preferred stock”);


•	series B convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “U.K.&I preferred stock”); and


•	series C convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Europe preferred stock”).



Accounting Purchase Consideration
(in millions)

Less: Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss(3)	(1,856	)
Less: Treasury stock(4)	(170	)
Total accounting purchase consideration	$	18,784


(1)	The fair value of preferred stock was determined based on its as-converted value of $6.1 billion on June 21, 2016, less a 6% discount for illiquidity as these shares are subject to limitations on transferability. The fair value was also adjusted to reflect $25 million of "right to recover for covered losses" related to VE territory covered losses prior to the Closing. See Note 20—Legal Matters.


(2)	This amount reflects the fair value of deferred cash consideration of €1.0 billion, plus 4.0% compound annual interest, payable on the third anniversary of the Closing, discounted at a rate of 1.2%. At September 30, 2016, the deferred consideration of $1.2 billion reflects interest accretion recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016, more than offset by the impact of changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate from the Closing.


(3)	the loss upon consummation of the transaction resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. The Visa Europe Framework Agreement provided Visa Europe with a perpetual, exclusive right to operate the Visa business in the Visa Europe region in exchange for a license fee paid to Visa. Under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the license fee paid by Visa Europe has increased modestly since inception in 2007, while the value of the Visa Europe business has increased at a greater rate. Using an income approach, the Company assessed the contractual terms and conditions of the Framework Agreement as compared to current market conditions and the historical and expected financial performance of Visa Europe. Based on the analysis performed, the Company determined that the terms were not at fair value as determined under U.S. GAAP at the Closing. The present value of the expected differential between payments required by the Framework Agreement and those that would be required if the contract were at fair value under U.S. GAAP was calculated over the Framework Agreement's contractual perpetual term, resulting in a loss of $1.9 billion recognized within operating expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, and a reduction to the purchase accounting consideration; and


(4)	the fair value of the Visa class C common stock held by Visa Europe as of the Closing.

Fair value of net assets acquired	$	18,784


(1)	Current assets are largely comprised of cash and cash equivalents and settlement receivable.


(2)	Intangible assets consist of customer relationships and reacquired rights, which have been valued as a single composite intangible asset as they are inextricably linked. These intangibles are considered indefinite-lived assets as the associated customer relationships have historically not experienced significant attrition, and the reacquired rights are based on the Framework Agreement, which has a perpetual term. Non-current assets and liabilities include deferred tax assets and liabilities that result in net deferred tax liabilities of $2.4 billion, which are primarily related to these indefinite-lived intangible assets, and are not expected to be realized in the foreseeable future.


(3)	Current liabilities assumed mainly include settlement payable, client incentives liabilities and accrued liabilities.


(4)	The excess of purchase consideration over net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which represents the value that is expected from increased scale and synergies as a result of the integration of both businesses.

•	conversion of Visa Europe's historical results of operations from euro to U.S. dollar, and from International Financial Reporting Standards to U.S. GAAP;


•	elimination of transactions between Visa and Visa Europe upon consolidation, primarily related to annual license and various other fees paid by Visa Europe to Visa in accordance with the Framework Agreement;


•	an increase in non-operating expense for additional interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from the issuance of the $16.0 billion senior notes;


•	exclusion of a $255 million gain in the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 and $110 million loss in the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 related to the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option(1); and


•	the inclusion of non-recurring amounts on October 1, 2014, the date the acquisition is presumed to have occurred for purposes of presenting pro forma results, and a corresponding reduction of these amounts in the period originally recognized, as follows:


◦	$1.9 billion Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement recognized in the twelve months ended September 30, 2016;


◦	$152 million of acquisition-related costs for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016;


◦	$145 million of foreign exchange gains related to euros held during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016; and


◦	$74 million of gains for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration.


(1)	For purposes of preparing this pro forma financial information, the fair value of the Visa Europe put option is presumed to have been reduced to zero prior to October 1, 2014. Therefore, gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option liability are not included in  pro forma net income for either period presented.
