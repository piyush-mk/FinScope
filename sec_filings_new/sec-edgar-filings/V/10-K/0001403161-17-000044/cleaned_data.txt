(1)	As of September 30, 2017


(2)	As of June 30, 2017


(3)	Transacted on our payment products for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017


•	Protecting payment data with a payments architecture that complies with industry standards;


•	Rendering the use of sensitive payment data useless by deploying technologies such as the EMV chip and tokenization;


•	Using predictive analytics, intelligence, and insights to identify and prevent fraud before it happens; and


•	Empowering consumers to actively protect their own financial information and transactions.


(1)	Figures and period-over-period percentages reflect the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year of fiscal 2017. We acquired Visa Europe on June 21, 2016.


(2)	Please see Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of our adjusted financial results.


(3)	For the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, upon which fiscal 2017 service revenues are based.


(1)	UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table as Visa currently does not compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart.


(2)	The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients, inclusive of Europe for the second half of calendar year 2016. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa.


(3)	MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1109 (May 2017). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products.


•	competitors, clients and others are developing alternate payment networks or products that could disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives from The Clearing House, an association comprised of large financial institutions that is developing its own faster payments system, and Early Warning Services, which operates Zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions;


•	similarly, multiple countries are developing or promoting real-time payment systems or mandating local networks with clients that also present a risk of disintermediation to our business;


•	competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from consumer checking accounts;


•	parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain;


•	parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms;


•	we may need to adjust our local rules and practices to remain competitive amidst evolving regulatory landscapes and competitors’ practices;


•	we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by consumers, processors or other third parties, thereby increasing operational costs;


•	we may need to agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of Visa’s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing risk of litigation concerning intellectual property, as more technology companies compete with our offerings;


•	participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services;


•	as this landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new business, products, services and practices; or


•	new or revised industry standards related to EMV chip payment technology, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other technologies set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services.


•	disruption to our ongoing business, including diversion of resources and management’s attention from our existing business;


•	greater than expected investment of resources or operating expenses;


•	failure to develop the acquired business adequately;


•	difficulty implementing controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;


•	challenges of integrating new employees, business cultures, business systems, and technologies;


•	failure to retain employees, clients, or partners of the acquired business;


•	in the case of foreign acquisitions, risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with operating in new regions or countries. For more information on regulatory risks, please see Item 1—Business—Government Regulations and Item 1A—Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks above;


•	discovery of unidentified issues after the acquisition or investment was made;


•	failure to mitigate the liabilities of the acquired business;


•	dilutive issuance of equity securities, if new securities are issued;


•	the incurrence of debt;


•	negative impact on our financial position and/or statement of operations; and


•	anticipated benefits, synergies, or value of the investment or acquisition not materializing.


•	no person may beneficially own more than 15% of our class A common stock (or 15% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis), unless our board of directors approves the acquisition of such shares in advance;


•	no competitor or an affiliate of a competitor may hold more than 5% of our total outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis;


•	the affirmative votes of the class B and C common stock and series B and series C preferred stock are required for certain types of consolidations or mergers;


•	our stockholders may only take action during a stockholders’ meeting and may not act by written consent; and


•	only the board of directors, Chairman, or CEO may call a special meeting of stockholders.

(1)	Includes 16,235 shares of class A common stock withheld at an average price of $99.15 per share (per the terms of grants under the Visa 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan) to offset tax withholding obligations that occur upon vesting and release of restricted shares.


(2)	The figures in the table reflect transactions according to the trade dates. For purposes of our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the impact of these repurchases is recorded according to the settlement dates.


(3)	Our board of directors from time to time authorizes the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a certain monetary limit. In April 2017, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $5.0 billion. This authorization has no expiration date. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to April 2017 have been completed.

(1)	The maximum number of shares issuable as of September 30, 2017 consisted of 7,115,876 outstanding options, 4,673,701 outstanding restricted stock units and 937,675 outstanding performance shares under the EIP and 353,980 purchase rights outstanding under the ESPP.


(2)	The weighted-average exercise price is calculated based solely on the exercise prices of the outstanding stock options and does not reflect the shares that will be issued upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and performance shares, which have no exercise price. Additionally, it excludes the weighted-average exercise price of the outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP, as the exercise price is based on the future stock price, net of discount, at the end of each monthly purchase over the offering period.


(3)	In January 2015, our class A stockholders approved the ESPP which permits eligible employees to purchase shares of Class A common stock at a 15% discount to the stock price on the purchase date, subject to certain restrictions. See Note 15—Share-based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. As of September 30, 2017, 149 million shares and 18 million shares remain available for issuance under the EIP and the ESPP, respectively.

(1)	Our results of operations for fiscal 2017 and the last quarter of fiscal 2016, and the financial position as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, include Visa Europe's financial results.


(2)	During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion.


(3)	During 2016, upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion.


(4)	The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.


(5)	During fiscal 2013, we made payments from the U.S. litigation escrow account totaling $4.4 billion in connection with the U.S. covered litigation. During fiscal 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. Certain merchants in the settlement classes objected to the settlement and filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received and deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account, and a related increase in accrued litigation to address the opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

(3)	Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below.


•	Elimination of deferred tax balances. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion.


•	Charitable contribution. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-recurring, non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million.


•	Severance cost. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions, including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million.


•	Remeasurement of deferred tax liability. In September 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of  Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom.


•	Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of UK stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million.


•	Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss. Upon consummation of the transaction, on June 21, 2016, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion.


•	Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million.


•	Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million.


•	Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a decrease of $255 million and an increase of $110 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income and expense in other non-operating income. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


(2)	Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.


(3)	Includes consumer prepaid volume and interlink volume.


(4)	Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.


(5)	Our nominal payments volume, total payments volume growth and total volume growth for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 does not reflect the related nominal payments volume of $477 billion and cash volume of $177 billion for Visa Europe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which impacts our service revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.


(6)	Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.


(7)	Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.

(1)	Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. Our operating revenues and related processed transactions for fiscal 2016 do not reflect the financial results or related processed transactions of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


(2)	Visa processed transactions in fiscal 2017 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 include transactions processed by Visa Europe.


(3)	As a result of changes in Russian National Payment System law, we transitioned the processing of Russian domestic transactions to the Russian NSPK during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The number of transactions processed by the Visa network does not reflect Russian domestic transactions processed after this transition.

(2)	Our operating revenues for fiscal 2016 do not reflect revenues earned by Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial.


•	Service revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 primarily due to 41% and 6% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume during fiscal 2017, reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. Fiscal 2017 and 2016 growth also reflected select pricing modifications.


•	Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 34% and 17%, respectively. The growth in data processing revenues was slower than the growth in processed transactions, reflecting the inclusion of data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield.


•	International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 79% and 37%, respectively, which includes revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our corresponding yield. International transaction revenue growth in fiscal 2017 and 2016 also reflected select pricing modifications, which was partially offset in fiscal 2017 by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies.


•	Client incentives increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016, reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2017 and 2016 and the inclusion of Visa Europe's incentives for fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

(2)	Our operating expenses for fiscal 2016 do not reflect the expenses incurred by Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial.


(3)	Operating expenses for fiscal 2017 and 2016 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance as they are related to the charitable donation or the Visa Europe acquisition. See Overview within this Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


•	Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2017 driven by higher incentive compensation, combined with continued increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. The increase in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a severance charge related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in contractor costs, an increase in personnel costs that were invested in and capitalized as part of technology development projects and lower incentive compensation.


•	Network and processing expenses increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 due to fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions that transitioned to the Russian NSPK during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.


•	Professional fees increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016.


•	Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.


•	General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to $192 million of expense related to the Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe that were received by the newly-formed Visa Foundation, as well as an increase in expense to provide product benefits to our account holders as a result of business growth. The increase in 2016 was mainly due to costs incurred related to our acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016 as well as net foreign exchange losses incurred as a result of changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against other currencies in which we transact.

(2)	Fiscal 2016 non-operating (expense) income includes financial results of Visa Europe for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, but does not reflect the financial results of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial.


•	Interest expense increased during fiscal 2017 and 2016 primarily due to the issuance of fixed-rate senior notes in each respective period. See Note 8—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


•	Other non-operating (expense) income in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of the following:


▪	net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition;


▪	a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition;


▪	a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero; and


▪	a non-cash adjustment of $110 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to increase the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax.


•	the aforementioned $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision related to the legal entity reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017;


•	$71 million tax benefit related to Visa Foundation's receipt of Visa Inc. shares mentioned above, recorded in fiscal 2017;


•	$70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report; and


•	the absence of:


▪	the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016;


▪	an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and


▪	the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016.


•	the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition, as mentioned above, that impacted the geographic mix of global income resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016;


•	an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016;


•	the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016; and


•	the absence of a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million was a one-time $239 million tax benefit that related to prior fiscal years.

(2)	Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.


(3)	Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty years.


(4)	Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners is unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These payment amounts are our best estimates and will likely change materially based on actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements, which are also estimates that will likely change materially due to the same factors described above.


(5)	Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.


(6)	Includes expected dividend amount of $459 million as dividends were declared in October 2017 and will be paid on December 5, 2017 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 17, 2017.


(7)	On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Amount presented was converted to U.S. dollar at the September 30, 2017 exchange rate. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


(8)	We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.1 billion. At September 30, 2017, we had also accrued $84 million of interest and $34 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.


(9)	We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 9—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

•	The Company recorded excess tax benefits of $70 million in its provision for income taxes rather than as an increase to additional paid-in capital for the year ended September 30, 2017 on a prospective basis. Therefore, the prior period presented has not been adjusted.


•	The Company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share, which did not have a material impact on the Company's diluted earnings per share for the year ended September 30, 2017.


•	The Company elected to apply the presentation requirement for cash flows related to excess tax benefits prospectively, and thus, the prior period presented has not been adjusted. This adoption resulted in an increase to both net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in financing of $70 million for the year ended September 30, 2017.


•	issued preferred stock of the Company convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock of the Company, as described below, equivalent to a value of €5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016; and


•	agreed to pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing.


•	series A convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which is generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company’s class A common stock (the “class A equivalent preferred stock”);


•	series B convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “UK&I preferred stock”); and


•	series C convertible participating preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Europe preferred stock”).

(1)	Current assets are largely comprised of cash and cash equivalents and settlement receivable.


(2)	Intangible assets consist of customer relationships and reacquired rights, which have been valued as a single composite intangible asset as they are inextricably linked. These intangibles are considered indefinite-lived assets as the associated customer relationships have historically not experienced significant attrition, and the reacquired rights are based on the Framework Agreement, which has a perpetual term. Non-current assets and liabilities include deferred tax assets and liabilities that result in net deferred tax liabilities of $1.7 billion, which are primarily related to these indefinite-lived intangible assets, based on the final valuation. In February 2017, the Company completed a legal entity reorganization, resulting in the elimination of most of these deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Note 18—Income Taxes.


(3)	Current liabilities assumed mainly include settlement payable, client incentives liabilities and accrued liabilities.


(4)	The excess of purchase consideration over net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which represents the value that is expected from increased scale and synergies as a result of the integration of both businesses.

(1)	Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. The number of shares and per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. See Note 13—Stockholders' Equity.


(2)	Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 405 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 58 million, 75 million and 87 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock, included within participating securities, was 33 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock, and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for fiscal 2017.


(3)	Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 5 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2017 and 2016 and 6 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2015, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 2 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.


(4)	Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. UK&I and Europe preferred stock were issued as part of the purchase price consideration in connection

(1)	This assumption is based on the Company's historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The Company's data is weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visa's initial public offering as a percentage of the options' contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visa's data and peer data in fiscal 2017 was approximately 87% and 13%, respectively, and 77% and 23% in fiscal 2016, respectively and 67% and 33% in fiscal 2015, respectively.


(2)	Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards.


(3)	Based on the Company’s implied and historical volatility. The expected volatility was 20% in fiscal 2017 and ranged from 20% to 23% in fiscal 2016 and 21% to 23% in fiscal 2015.
