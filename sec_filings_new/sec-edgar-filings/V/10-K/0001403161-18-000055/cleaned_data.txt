•	We provide transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through VisaNet, our global processing platform. During fiscal 2018, we saw 182 billion payments and cash transactions with Visa’s brand, equating to an average of 500 million transactions a day. Of the 182 billion total transactions, 124.3 billion were processed by Visa.


•	We offer a wide range of Visa-branded payment products, which our financial institution clients use to develop and offer core business solutions, credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs for account holders (individuals, businesses and government entities). Our scale and reach are made possible by a network of 15,900 financial institution clients that issue Visa-branded products. During fiscal 2018, Visa’s total payments and cash volume grew to $11.2 trillion and more than 3.3 billion cards were available worldwide to be used at nearly 54 million business and merchant locations.


•	We provide other value-added services to our clients, including fraud and risk management, debit issuer processing, loyalty services, dispute management, digital services like tokenization, as well as consulting and analytics.


•	We manage and promote our brands to the benefit of our clients and partners through advertising, promotional and sponsorship initiatives with the Olympic Games, FIFA and the National Football League, among others. We also use these sponsorship assets to showcase our payment innovations.


•	We have adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.


•	We have accelerated the pace of change in digital payments by making application programming interfaces (APIs) available in an effort to increase access to our network, products and services, offering innovation opportunities at our ten global innovation network locations, and building partnerships with new players, such as financial technology companies, commonly known as fintechs.

(3)	As of September 30, 2018


•	Protecting payment data with a payments architecture that complies with industry standards


•	Rendering sensitive payment data useless by deploying technologies such as EMV® chip, EMV tokenization, and encryption


•	Using predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and insights in an effort to identify and prevent fraud before it happens


•	Empowering consumers to actively protect their own financial information and transactions


(2)	For the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, upon which fiscal 2018 service revenues are based.


(1)	UnionPay, which operates primarily within the Chinese domestic market, is not included in this table as Visa currently does not compete in that market under local law. Although we are uncertain how UnionPay reports certain volumes, reportedly its numbers could approach or exceed some of those listed in this chart.


(2)	The data presented are provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data are subject to review by Visa.


(3)	MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover/Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1130 (April 2018). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards.

Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products.


•	competitors, clients and others are developing alternate payment networks or products, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, faster payment initiatives and payment services that permit ACH or direct debits from consumer checking accounts, that could reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives from The Clearing House, an association comprised of large financial institutions that is developing its own faster payments system, and Early Warning Services, which operates Zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions;


•	similarly, multiple countries are developing or promoting real-time payment systems or mandating local networks with clients that also present a risk of disintermediation to our business and some regions, such as Southeast Asia, under the auspices of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), are looking into cross-border connectivity of such systems;


•	parties that process our transactions may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payments value chain;


•	parties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate account holders and other clients to alternate payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms;


•	participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services; and


•	new or revised industry standards related to the EMV Secure Remote Commerce, cloud-based payments, tokenization or other payments-related technologies set by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, American National Standards Institute, World Wide Web Consortium, European Card Standards Group and EMVCo may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services.

(1)	Our results of operations and the financial position beginning with the last quarter of fiscal 2016 include Visa Europe’s financial results.


(2)	During fiscal 2016, upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe.


(3)	During fiscal 2018, as a result of the U.S. tax reform legislation, our net income reflected a lower statutory tax rate, a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion from the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities, and a one-time transition tax of approximately $1.1 billion.


(4)	During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion.


(5)	The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.


(6)	During fiscal 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. Certain merchants in the settlement classes objected to the settlement and filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received and deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account, and a related increase in accrued litigation to address the opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2018, pursuant to an amended settlement agreement that superseded the 2012 Settlement Agreement, we recorded an additional accrual of $600 million.

(2)	Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below.


•	Charitable contributions


▪	During fiscal 2018, we donated available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million, before tax, and recorded $193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income decreased by $49 million.


▪	During fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million.


•	Litigation provision. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $600 million and related tax benefits of $137 million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock.


•	Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act’s reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion.


•	Transition tax on foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act’s requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion.


•	Elimination of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion.


•	Severance cost. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions, including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million.


•	Remeasurement of deferred tax liability. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom.


•	Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of UK stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million.


•	Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss. During fiscal 2016, upon consummation of the Visa Europe transaction, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion.


•	Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million.


•	Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million.


•	Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a decrease of $255 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income in other non-operating income. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision.

(1)	Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


(2)	Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.


(3)	Includes consumer prepaid volume and interlink volume.


(4)	Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.


(5)	Our nominal payments volume, total payments volume growth and total volume growth for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 does not reflect the related nominal payments volume of $477 billion and cash volume of $177 billion for Visa Europe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which impacts our service revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.


(6)	Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.


(7)	As a result of European Union Interchange Fee regulation changes, effective with the quarter ended December 31, 2016, Europe co-badged payments volume is no longer included in reported volume. For comparative purposes, prior year figures were adjusted to exclude co-badged volume. The associated growth rates for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were calculated using these adjusted amounts.


(8)	Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.

(2)	Our operating revenues for fiscal 2016 do not reflect revenues earned by Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial.


•	Service revenues increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 primarily due to 13% and 39% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume during fiscal 2017, reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield.


•	Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 12% and 34%, respectively. Fiscal 2018 growth also reflected select pricing modifications. The growth in data processing revenues was slower than the growth in processed transactions during fiscal 2017, reflecting the inclusion of data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield.


•	International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 14% and 79%, respectively, and select pricing modifications. International transaction revenue growth in fiscal 2017 also reflects the inclusion of revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our corresponding yield, which was partially offset by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies.


•	Client incentives increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017, reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives recognized on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2018 and 2017 and the inclusion of Visa Europe’s incentives for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

See Overview within this Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


•	Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 driven by continued increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth.


•	Marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher spending in support of a number of campaigns, including the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 and 2018 FIFA World CupTM.

(2)	Fiscal 2016 non-operating income (expense) includes financial results of Visa Europe for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, but does not reflect the financial results of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial.


•	Interest expense increased during fiscal 2018 and 2017 primarily due to the issuance of fixed-rate senior notes in fiscal 2017 and 2016. See Note 6—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


•	Other non-operating income (expense) increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to gains of $292 million from the donation of securities to the Visa Foundation and sales of investments. Other non-operating income (expense) decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the absence of the following:


▪	net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition;


▪	a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition; and


▪	a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero.


•	the effects of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below;


•	$161 million of tax benefits due to various non-recurring audit settlements in fiscal 2018; and


•	the absence of the following items related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017:


▪	a $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe; and


▪	a $71 million one-time tax benefit related to the Visa Foundation’s receipt of Visa Inc. shares, previously recorded by Visa Europe as treasury stock.


•	the items listed above related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017;


•	$70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09; and


•	the absence of:


▪	the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016;


▪	an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and


▪	the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016.

(1)	Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 6—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


(2)	Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.


(3)	Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty years.


(4)	Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 16—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.


(5)	Includes expected dividend amount of $574 million as dividends were declared on October 16, 2018 and will be paid on December 4, 2018 to all holders of record of Visa’s common stock as of November 16, 2018.


(6)	On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Amount presented was converted to U.S. dollar at the September 30, 2018 exchange rate.


(7)	We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2018. At September 30, 2018, we had also accrued $99 million of interest and $34 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.


(8)	We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 7—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


(9)	Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to eleven years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. As of September 30, 2018, we have $2.8 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements.

(1)	Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.


(2)	Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 403 million for fiscal 2018, and 405 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 49 million, 58 million and 75 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million and 33 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for fiscal 2018 and 2017.


(3)	Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 3 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2018, and 5 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2017 and 2016, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 1 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2018, and 2 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2017 and 2016, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.


(4)	Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. See Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity.

(1)	Until March 2018, this assumption was based on the Company’s historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believed to be generally comparable to Visa. The Company’s data was weighted based on the number of years between the measurement date and Visa’s IPO date as a percentage of the options’ contractual term. The relative weighting placed on Visa’s data and peer data for stock options granted until March 2018 in fiscal 2018 was approximately 97% and 3%, respectively, 87% and 13% in fiscal 2017, respectively, and 77% and 23% in fiscal 2016, respectively. The assumptions for stock options granted after March 2018 was based on Visa’s historical exercise experience as the passage of time since the Company’s IPO has exceeded 10 years.


(2)	Based upon the zero coupon U.S. treasury bond rate over the expected term of the awards.

•	Tax on global intangible low-tax income, which, in general, is determined annually based on the Company’s aggregate foreign subsidiaries’ income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return. This provision is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018. The Company needs additional information to complete its analysis on whether to adopt an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of global intangible low-tax income in the period that it is subject to such tax, or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that, upon reversal, may be subject to such tax. Hence, the Company has not recorded any tax on global intangible low-tax income in fiscal 2018. The Company will make an accounting policy election no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019.


•	Base erosion and anti-abuse tax, which, in general, functions like a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions. This new minimum tax is determined on a year-by-year basis, and this provision is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018. Hence, no base erosion anti-abuse tax has been recorded in fiscal 2018.


•	Deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income derived from serving foreign markets. This provision is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018. Hence, the Company has not recorded the impact of this provision in fiscal 2018.


•	Other new tax provisions, which disallow certain deductions related to entertainment expenses, fringe benefits provided to employees, executive compensation, and fines or penalties or similar payments to governments. The Company has recorded provisional amounts for the tax effects of these new provisions in fiscal 2018, based on information currently available. The provisional amounts may change no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019, if additional information is obtained and analyzed.

•	the absence of the following items related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017:


▪	a $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe; and


▪	a $71 million one-time tax benefit related to the Visa Foundation’s receipt of Visa Inc. shares, previously recorded by Visa Europe as treasury stock.


•	the items listed above related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017;


•	$70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of ASU 2016-09; and


•	the absence of:


▪	the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016;


•	an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and


•	the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016.
