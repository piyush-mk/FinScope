•	the impact of laws, regulations and marketplace barriers, including:


•	rules capping debit interchange reimbursement rates and expanding financial institutions' and merchants' choices among debit payment networks promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act;


•	increased regulation in jurisdictions outside of the United States and in other product categories;


•	increased government support of national payment networks outside the United States; and


•	increased regulation on consumer privacy, data use and security;


•	developments in litigation and government enforcement, including those affecting interchange reimbursement fees, antitrust and tax;


•	new lawsuits, investigations or proceedings, or changes to our potential exposure in connection with pending lawsuits, investigations or proceedings;


•	economic factors, such as:


•	economic fragility in the Eurozone and the United States;


•	general economic, political and social conditions in mature and emerging markets globally;


•	material changes in cross-border activity, foreign exchange controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and


•	material changes in our financial institution clients' performance compared to our estimates;


•	industry developments, such as competitive pressure, rapid technological developments and disintermediation from our payments network;


•	system developments, such as:


•	disruption of our transaction processing systems or the inability to process transactions efficiently;


•	account data breaches or increased fraudulent or other illegal activities involving Visa-branded cards or payment products; and


•	failure to maintain systems interoperability with Visa Europe;


•	costs arising if Visa Europe were to exercise its right to require us to acquire all of its outstanding stock;

ITEM 1.	Business


•	Leadership. Charles W. Scharf joined the Company as Chief Executive Officer and became a member of our board of directors on November 1, 2012. Ryan McInerney joined the Company as President on June 3, 2013.


•	Product innovation. Visa’s fundamental approach to innovation focuses on enhancing our current product platforms, enabling more Visa transactions in every channel, and extending the utility of our products and services to additional access points, such as eCommerce and mobile, new merchant segments and new geographies. We continue to invest in the development of eCommerce and mobile payment platforms, contact and contactless chip cards and devices, card product enhancements, authentication and security technologies and platforms, and money transfers.


•	Client contracts. In 2013, we partnered with one of our largest financial institution clients to customize a processing solution using VisaNet that is designed to accelerate the growth of electronic payments, deliver added value to merchants and provide a better experience for account holders.


•	Regulation. Rules were implemented in the United States during 2011 and 2012 with respect to debit products under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), which regulates, among other things, debit interchange reimbursements rates, the availability of debit networks, financial institutions' and merchants' choices among these networks, and transaction routing. As a result, we have significantly modified our debit strategy and continue to renegotiate some portions of our contracts with our financial institution clients. In July 2013, a federal court invalidated these rules and ordered the U.S. Federal Reserve to revise them. However, that order has been stayed, and the rules have been left in place, pending the resolution of an expedited appeal filed by the Federal Reserve to the federal appeals court. See Government Regulation below.


•	Interchange multidistrict litigation settlement. In 2012, we reached a settlement in the interchange multidistrict litigation, subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeals. We believe that this settlement ensures the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. See Item 1A—Risk Factors—Our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate us from the impact of settlements or final judgments and Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20—Legal Matters included elsewhere in this report.


•	Service revenues. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Service revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services.


•	Data processing revenues. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our financial institution clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily generated from the number of transactions we process.


•	International transaction revenues. International transaction revenues consist of revenues earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume.


•	Client incentives. Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues.


•	Debit. Our debit payment solutions support issuers' payment products that draw on demand deposit accounts, such as checking accounts.


•	Prepaid. Our prepaid payment solutions support issuers' payment products that access a pre-funded amount, allowing account holders to enjoy the convenience and security of a payment card in lieu of cash or checks.


•	Credit. Our credit payment solutions support issuers' deferred payment and customized financing products.


•	paper-based payments, principally cash and checks;


•	card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM, prepaid and private-label products;


•	eCommerce and mobile-based payments; and


•	other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, automated clearing house ("ACH"), and electronic data interchange.

(1)	The data presented is provided by our financial institution clients. Previously submitted information may be updated and all data is subject to review by Visa.


(2)	MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Diners Club data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1014 (March 2013) and Discover data sourced from The Nilson Report issue 1009 (January 2013). Includes all consumer and commercial credit, debit and prepaid cards. Some figures are estimates and currency figures are in U.S. dollars. MasterCard excludes Maestro and Cirrus figures. American Express includes figures for third-party issuers. Discover figures consist of U.S. data only and include third-party issuers. JCB figures include third-party issuers and other payment-related products.


•	Data protection and information security. Aspects of our operations and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Our financial institution clients in the United States are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies. In addition, many U.S. states have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach.


•	Regulatory compliance. We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. In addition, we are also subject to the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC that prohibit or restrict dealings with certain countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, as well as with


•	Regulation of the price of credit. Many jurisdictions in which Visa-branded cards are used have regulations that could increase the costs of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of issuers to charge market-based interest rates and fees on credit card accounts. These include the Credit CARD Act of 2009 in the United States and other proposed regulations under it. Proposed changes to the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, if implemented along with regulations required to be promulgated under the Credit CARD Act, could result in a decrease in our payments volume and revenues.


•	Increased central bank oversight. Several central banks around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the retail electronic payments industry, in some cases considering designating them as "systemically important payment systems" or "critical infrastructure." Any such oversight may lead to additional regulations by central banks and other government regulators. These could include new settlement procedures, cyber security requirements or other operational rules to address credit and operational risks. They could also include new criteria for financial institution client participation and merchant access to our payments system.


•	Safety and soundness regulation. Recent banking regulations enacted in the United States and elsewhere may make some financial institutions less attracted to becoming an issuer of Visa-branded cards, because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirements.


•	Regulation of Internet transactions. Proposed legislation in various jurisdictions may make it less desirable or more costly to complete Internet transactions using Visa-branded cards by affecting the legality of those transactions, the laws that govern the transactions, their taxation or the allocation of various intellectual property rights.


•	Money transfer regulations. As we expand our product offerings, we may become subject to U.S. state money transfer regulations, which could increase our regulatory oversight and compliance costs.


•	competitors, clients and others may develop products that compete with or replace the value-added services we provide to support our transaction processing;


•	parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position in the payments value chain;


•	we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services for use by our customers, processors or other third parties;


•	participants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enter into other business combinations that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services;


•	competition may increase from alternate types of payment services, such as mobile payment services, eCommerce payment services and services that permit direct debit of consumer checking accounts or ACH payments; or


•	new players and intermediaries in the value chain may direct the payment decision-making or impair the value of the services we provide.


•	Our clients may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as adverse creditor practices.


•	Our limited control over the quality of service and promotion of our brands in Europe could affect our brands and reputation globally. While Visa Europe has very broad latitude to use our brands and


•	We may be associated with adverse developments with respect to our industry, and with new rules and regulations concerning human rights conditions, our corporate responsibility regarding those conditions and resulting disclosure requirements.


•	Any negative perception of the United States arising from its political, economic, social or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brands globally by associating Visa with those positions.


•	Depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease account holder spending.


•	Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients' businesses may reduce the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets.


•	Our clients may implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing budgets or increase requests for greater incentives or reduced fees from us, which may reduce our revenues.


•	Our clients may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services, affecting our revenue and reducing account holders' desire to use these products.


•	Our clients may increase account holder fees as a cost-recovery initiative, or as a result of regulatory action, decreasing their value proposition to consumers and reducing consumers' desire to use our products.


•	Government intervention or investments in our clients may negatively affect our business with those institutions or otherwise alter their business decisions.


•	Tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility.


•	The U.S. government's inability to meet its obligations or a possible further downgrade in the U.S. debt rating could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments, a substantial portion of which are in U.S. treasury and government securities.


•	Our clients may default on their settlement obligations, including for reasons unrelated to payment card activity, such as mortgage loan commitments.


•	Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenues and payments in foreign currencies.


•	The current economic environment could lead some clients to curtail or postpone near-term investments in growing their card portfolios, limit credit lines, modify fees and loyalty programs, or take other actions that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue streams from these clients.


•	Declines in stock prices or significant instability could cause consumer spending to decline materially.

(1)	During fiscal 2012, we recorded: a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities; a covered litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits; and the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and interest, which increased net income by $326 million.


(2)	During fiscal 2013, we made payments from the litigation escrow account totaling $4.4 billion in connection with the covered litigation. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.


ITEM 7.	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


•	Reversal of tax reserves. During fiscal 2012, we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2011. This increased our net income for fiscal 2012 by $326 million.


•	Litigation provision. During fiscal 2012, we recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.


•	Deferred tax adjustment. During fiscal 2012, our reported financial results benefited from a one-time, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules.


•	Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a decrease of $122 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating income in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision.

•	Service revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 primarily due to 8% and 10% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. The growth in service revenues in fiscal 2012 was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume due to a shift in the mix of our payments volume, primarily in volume related to Interlink, which is a debit product that does not generate any service revenues.


•	Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 10% and 5%, respectively, combined with pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act.


•	International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 primarily reflecting 10% and 11% growth in nominal cross-border volume, respectively.


•	Other revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth.


•	Client incentives increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012, reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. These included a number of significant long-term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as issuer contracts executed in fiscal 2013. Additionally, client incentives increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume. Activity in fiscal 2012 also reflects certain one-time incentives incurred outside the United States. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% for the full 2014 fiscal year.

(2)	Excluding the litigation provision of $4.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2012, associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $4.2 billion, an increase of 12% over fiscal 2011 on an adjusted basis.


•	Personnel increased in fiscal 2013 mainly due to increases in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly in key product and geography-specific initiatives, combined with severance charges incurred as a result of organizational restructuring that better aligns our costs and strategic priorities. The increase in fiscal 2012 is primarily due to increases in headcount, and reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo in March 2011 and June 2011, respectively.


•	Marketing remained relatively flat in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 when compared to the respective prior year. Fiscal 2013 activity mainly reflected strategies to promote our core products, combined with a number of various campaigns, including the 2013 FIFA Confederation Cup and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Marketing in fiscal 2012 mainly reflected sponsorship of the 2012 London Summer Olympics, as well as spend in support of our new product initiatives.


•	Network and processing in fiscal 2013 and 2012 increased mainly due to costs incurred for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes.


•	Professional fees increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012, primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects.


•	Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012, primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives.


•	General and administrative remained flat in fiscal 2013 after experiencing an increase in fiscal 2012 mainly due to travel activities in support of our international expansion, combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2011 upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies.


•	Litigation provision in fiscal 2012 reflects a $4.1 billion accrual related to the covered litigation. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.


•	the absence of a $122 million non-cash adjustment to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011; and


•	the absence of a pre-tax gain of $85 million recognized in fiscal 2011 upon the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer Companhia Brasileira de Soluções e Serviços, or CBSS; offset by


•	the reversal of previously accrued interest expense discussed above.


•	the decrease in overall ongoing state tax rate beginning in fiscal 2012 as a result of changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year;


•	a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012;


•	certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013; and


•	the absence of the following in fiscal 2013:


•	the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense;


•	a fiscal 2012 one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year;


•	the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion covered litigation provision; and


•	the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011.

(2)	Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years.


(3)	Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to


(4)	Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.


(5)	Includes expected dividend amount of $255 million as dividends were declared in October 2013 and will be paid on December 3, 2013 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 15, 2013.


(6)	We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $453 million. At September 30, 2013, we also accrued $29 million of interest and $3 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.


(7)	Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2013 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.


(8)	We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

(1)	The increase in non-current income tax receivable is mainly due to amended tax returns filed during fiscal 2013.

(3)	The decrease in other investments was mainly due to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss and subsequent sale of an investment, combined with a reclassification of equity securities to long-term available-for-sale investment securities following a change in the Company's relationship with an investee.

(1)	Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented.


(2)	Net income attributable to Visa Inc. is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average numbers of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation were 103 million, 108 million and 123 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.


(3)	Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis, and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes 2 million common stock equivalents for fiscal 2013 and 3 million for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes less than 1 million of common stock equivalents for fiscal 2013 and 2012, and 2 million for fiscal 2011 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.


(4)	Participating securities are unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company's restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares.

As the Company’s publicly-traded stock history is relatively short, historical volatility relies in part on the historical volatility of a group of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to Visa. The relative weighting between Visa historical volatility and the historical volatility of the peer companies is based on the percentage of years Visa stock price information has been available since its initial public offering compared to the expected term. The expected volatilities ranged from 27% to 29% in fiscal 2013.


(4)	Based on the Company’s annual dividend rate on the date of grant.

•	A comprehensive release from participating class members for liability arising out of claims asserted in the litigation, and a further release to protect against future litigation regarding default interchange and the other U.S. rules at issue in the MDL;
